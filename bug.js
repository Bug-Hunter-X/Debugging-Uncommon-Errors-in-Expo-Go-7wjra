This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application and you encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.  It's often related to issues in your app's code rather than Expo Go itself, but debugging can be challenging due to the remote nature of the testing environment.  This can manifest as blank screens, unexpected rendering, or crashes without clear error messages in the console.
